# Great Awakening: Europa Mission

Great Awakening: Europa Mission is a collaborative project aimed at exploring the feasibility, technological needs, and potential costs associated with a manned mission to Jupiter's moon, Europa. This mission emphasizes the immense energy requirements, advanced propulsion technologies, and substantial safety measures necessary to ensure a successful mission beyond the Mars frontier.

## Project Overview

The concept extends beyond current Mars mission proposals, addressing the unique challenges posed by the vast distance to Europa, the harsh radiation environment of Jupiter, and the scientific potential of exploring an extraterrestrial ocean beneath Europa's icy crust.

## Mission Goals

1. **Feasibility Study**: Analyze the feasibility of a manned mission to Europa based on current and evolving space travel technologies.
2. **Cost Estimation**: Provide an estimated financial framework required for such a mission, converting these costs into both USD and Ethereum for a comprehensive understanding of the scale.
3. **Technological Roadmap**: Outline the advancements in technology necessary for travel, life support, communication, and landing on Europa.
4. **Safety and Sustainability**: Focus on the life support systems and safety protocols needed for the long-duration mission.

## Technical White Paper

The Technical White Paper includes detailed analyses of propulsion technologies, potential mission trajectories, and energy requirements. It also examines the necessary R&D efforts to overcome the environmental challenges of space travel to Europa.

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

The PRD details the specific requirements and specifications for the mission's spacecraft, life support systems, and scientific instruments. It serves as a guide for potential future developments in space exploration infrastructure.
